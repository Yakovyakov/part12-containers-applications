The answers are inside the folder script-answers </br>
Each exercise from 12.2 to 12.4 has 3 files:

- exercise12_[2-4].txt: contains the output of the script command
- exercise12_[2-4]_timing.txt: time file of the output of the script command
- exercise12_[2-4]_only_cmd.txt: contains only the executed commands

To show what exactly happened in the terminal during each exercise run the following command

```bash
# Exercise 12.3
scriptreplay script-answers/exercise12.3_timing.txt script-answers/exercise12.3.txt -m 0.2
```
